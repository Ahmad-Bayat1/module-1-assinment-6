            <br><br>
            Beeswax is a natural substance generated and secreted by honey bees that use it to develop their honeycombs. Beeswax is comprised largely of fatty acids, hydrocarbons, and esters.
The wax is hard and breakable when cold but soft and pliable when heated or exposed to human body temperature. Because Beeswax does not spoil, become rancid, or otherwise expire, it can continue to be reheated and reused.
Just like honey, Beeswax varies in colour, depending on various factors related to the bees themselves as well as the flowers from which the honey is derived.
There are 3 main types of Beeswax: Yellow, White, and Absolute. They vary in their processing methods, benefits, and uses. Yellow beeswax - what we have here - is not bleached.
Used cosmetically, e.g. lip balms, waxes or makeup, beeswax hydrates, conditions, soothes, and calms the skin. It exfoliates, repairs damage, promotes the skin's regeneration, diminishes the appearance of the signs of aging, soothes itchiness and irritation, and creates a hydrating, long-lasting protective barrier against environmental pollutants.
Used medicinally, e.g. in topical ointments, beeswax helps soothe and facilitate the healing of abrasions. It prevents harmful bacteria from entering the body through chapped and broken skin and it provides the skin with a layer of protection against external irritants.
Used in aromatherapy, beeswax candles are known for its long, slow, clean, smoke-less burn. It not only exudes the aroma of honey but it also produces comparatively brighter flames, facilitates the elimination of airborne pollutants, and promotes the overall health of body and mind.
